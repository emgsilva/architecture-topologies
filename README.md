# Architecture Topologies - language, patterns and resources

This repo collects architecture topologies (proposals) and resources on this topic.

To describe the Architecture Topology, a simple base language will be used to describe the topologies in a consistent form.

Goal: gather insights and shape a more commonly accepted language and understanding on how can we organize and evolve architecture teams/craft in organization.
